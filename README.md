In this workshop, we aim to demonstrate how our new R package [*ontophylo*](https://github.com/diegosasso/ontophylo) can be used to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic entities composed of amalgamated characters, such as entire phenomes or anatomical regions. *Ontophylo*  offers three new applications: (1) reconstructing evolutionary rates of amalgamated characters using phylogenetic non-homogeneous Poisson process (pNHPP), allowing for rate variation and shifts over time and phylogeny; (2) explicit reconstruction of morphospace dynamics; and (3) direct visualization of evolutionary rates and statistics on vector images of organisms. *Ontophylo*  incorporates ontological knowledge to facilitate these applications.
